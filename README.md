# EconomyFrame
Buy Items through configured Item Frames using EssentialsX Economy.

## Pre-requisites

Mandatory: EssentialsX >= 2.19.0
Optional: WeaponMechanics 4.1.5

## Usage

`/economyframe {price}` This will allow you to place a frame configured with a price point. Add your item into the frame and then the item is permanently bound to that itemframe. Persists through server restarts. For those using WeaponMechanics, it has support for weapons with ammunition and weapons without. If you decide to place a weapon inside an itemframe with ammunition; upon purchasing the weapon again again, you'll get 1 ammunition item for 50% of the configured price.


## Where can I see this in action?

QuartzSMP (Server: quartzsmp.com) host a CoD Zombies Lobby that uses WeaponMechanics and EconomyFrame is in use there. The Zombies code is a commercial plugin built by me and is available for Â£10 if you are interested. You can then combine both together for a close-to CoD Zombies experience.
